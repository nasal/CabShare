# CabShare
Simple mobile app developed in Telerik's AppBuilder (Icenium at the time) at a hackathon in 2014.

## The idea
The idea was to offer people the chance to share a cab to split the costs. 
The user could choose where they were and where they were going and find people that shared the same (or piece of the same) route.

### Pls note
This was written in a day so the code is messy.

Visual Studio solution, won't work if you don't have the AppBuilder extension for VS installed.
